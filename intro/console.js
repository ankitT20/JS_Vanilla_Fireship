üßê The Console
Go beyond console.log() like and debug like a pro
At this point in your JS career, you likely know what console.log does - but the Console API can do so much more! It can be an effective debugging tool, but it can also be nightmare when abused. Let‚Äôs take a look at some tricks that will keep your console output concise and beautiful. Open the console on your browser by running Ctrl + Shift + J to get started with this section.

let bar = 'üòê';
let foo = 'üòç';
loggedIn = false;
// First, inspect the methods on the console that go beyond log, by running:
console.log( console );

// This article is focused on frontend browser JS, but the Node Console API is almost identical.


// Console FAQ
// How to show variable names when console logging?
// It is easy for variable names to get jumbled-up when you have tons of output to the console. Wrap your variables in braces {} to make them an object, or brackets [] to make them an array, then use console.table to make them pretty.
console.log(bar, foo);

// Wait, which variable is named foo? 

console.log({ foo, bar });

// Better, but it's kinda hard to read...

console.table({ foo, bar });

// Noice!
// Output of console.table()


// How to group console logs?
// You might not care about every line outputted into the console. Remove the clutter by grouping logs into a collapsible section with group or groupCollapsed.
console.group();

console.log(1);
console.log(2);
console.log(3);

console.groupEnd();


// How to conditionally console log?
// Sometimes you want to log ONLY when a condition is falsey - this is known as an assertion. It will keep your code concise by eliminating the need for if statements.
// verbose üí©
if (loggedIn) {
    console.error('user is logged in assertion failed');
}

// much better üòç 
console.assert(loggedIn, 'user is logged in');
// Output of console.assert()


// How to increment a counter in the console?
// Keeping a counter running in your source code means managing mutable state - you probably don‚Äôt want that extra complexity. Instead, use count to tell the browser to increment a counter for you.
console.count();
console.count();
console.count();

console.countReset(); // reset to zero
// Output of console.count()


// How to set a timer with the console?
// You can start a timer with the console by calling time, then call timeLog to measure the elapsed time. It provides a simple solution for measuring performance.
console.time('myTimer');

// do stuff

console.timeLog('myTimer', 'did stuff');


// do more stuff

console.timeLog('myTimer', 'did more stuff');

console.timeEnd('myTimer')


// How to add custom CSS styles to the console output?
// Use the special %c character to add some custom CSS flavor to the console. This is a surefire way to impress other developers, especially if you maintain an open source library.
console.log('%c YOUR_MESSAGE', 'YOUR_CSS')
// Custom CSS styles in browser console
